# Weather-Dashboard
This is a simple weather application that allows the user to search for the current weather conditions and 5-day forecast of any city in the world. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data and displays it on the screen using JavaScript.

To use the app, the user enters the name of the city they want to check the weather for in the search bar, and then clicks the "Search" button. The app then makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast for that city.

The current weather conditions are displayed at the top of the screen, including the city name, the current date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
